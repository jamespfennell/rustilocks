# Rustilocks

Rust implemention of the Lox bytecode intepreter in Crafting Interpreters.

## Goals

- Fully implement the interpreter to really understand how such interpreters work.

- Gain more experience with Rust.

- Use only safe Rust and try to write code to be panic-free.

## Non-goals

- Performance. Prefer to use simple idiomatic Rust.

- Implementing hash maps, stacks, etc. by hand, as is done in the book; instead, use the Rust standard library.

## Status

- Chapter 14-15: done

- Chapter 16: in progress.

- Chapter 17-30: to be started
