# Rustilocks

Rust implemention of the Lox bytecode intepreter in the book
    [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Goals

- Fully implement the interpreter to really understand how such interpreters work.

- Gain more experience with Rust.

- Try to make all code safe and statically panic-free.

## Non-goals

- Performance. Prefer to use simple idiomatic Rust.

- Implementing hash maps, stacks, etc. by hand, as is done in the book; instead, use the Rust standard library.

## Status

- Chapter 14-16: done

- Chapter 17: in progress.

- Chapter 18-29: to be started
